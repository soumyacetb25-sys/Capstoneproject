🤖 What is ADK?
The Agent Development Kit (ADK) is Google's powerful framework for building AI agents that can:

🗣️ Understand natural language conversations
🛠️ Use specialized tools and capabilities
💾 Remember information across sessions
🔧 Integrate with other systems and APIs
💡 What's Special About Persistent Storage?
Unlike simple chatbots that forget everything when you close them, this agent remembers everything! Using ADK's DatabaseSessionService, all your projects, tasks, and team data is automatically saved to an SQLite database. Close the app, restart your computer, come back next week - your agent will remember exactly where you left off! 🧠✨

🚀 Quick Start
Ready to get your projects organized? Let's get you up and running in just a few minutes!

1. 🛠️ Environment Setup
# Create virtual environment (if not already created)
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment (Windows PowerShell)
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Activate the virtual environment (Linux/Mac)
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. 🔑 API Key Configuration
Create a .env file in this directory with your Google API key:

GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
Need an API key? Get yours from the Google AI Studio - it's free to get started! 🎉

3. 🎯 Run the Application
python main.py
4. (Optional) API Server Configuration
# Start just the API server without the UI
adk api_server --agent-module project_management_agent.agent:project_management_agent
# Start the API server with a custom port
adk api_server --agent-module project_management_agent.agent:project_management_agent --port 8080
This exposes REST endpoints at http://localhost:8080 that you can call from any application.

That's it! Your Project Manager Agent is ready to help you stay organized! 🎊

Understanding Persistent Storage in ADK
This project demonstrates a key ADK concept: persistent storage using the DatabaseSessionService. Here's how it works:

Database Session Service
from google.adk.sessions import DatabaseSessionService

# Initialize with an SQLite database
db_url = "sqlite:///./project_management_data.db"
session_service = DatabaseSessionService(db_url=db_url)
The DatabaseSessionService connects to a database where all conversation and state information is stored. This is what allows the agent to "remember" information between different sessions.

Session Management Process
# Check for existing sessions for this user
existing_sessions = session_service.list_sessions(
    app_name=APP_NAME,
    user_id=USER_ID,
)

# If there's an existing session, use it, otherwise create a new one
if existing_sessions and len(existing_sessions.sessions) > 0:
    # Use the most recent session
    SESSION_ID = existing_sessions.sessions[0].id
    print(f"Continuing existing session: {SESSION_ID}")
else:
    # Create a new session with initial state
    new_session = session_service.create_session(
        app_name=APP_NAME,
        user_id=USER_ID,
        state=initial_state,
    )
    SESSION_ID = new_session.id
    print(f"Created new session: {SESSION_ID}")
This code demonstrates how the application finds existing sessions for a user or creates a new one if needed.

State Updates with Tool Context
def add_project(name: str, tool_context: ToolContext, description: Optional[str] = None, 
                due_date: Optional[str] = None) -> dict:
    # Handle default values inside the function
    if description is None:
        description = "No description provided"
    if due_date is None:
        due_date = "2025-12-31"
        
    # Get current projects from state
    projects = tool_context.state.get("projects", [])
    
    # Add the new project
    projects.append({
        "name": name,
        "description": description,
        "due_date": due_date,
        "tasks": [],
        "created_at": datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
    })
    
    # Update state with the new list of projects
    tool_context.state["projects"] = projects
    
    return {
        "action": "add_project",
        "project": name,
        "message": f"Added project: {name} with due date {due_date}"
    }
This example shows how tools update the state through tool_context.state. Any changes made to the state are automatically saved to the database.

Production Database Options
For production use, you might want to switch to a more robust database like PostgreSQL:

# Example of using PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
db_url = "postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/project_management"
session_service = DatabaseSessionService(db_url=db_url)
The same code can work with different database backends by simply changing the connection string.
